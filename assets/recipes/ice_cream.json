I have been so disappointed in store bought ice cream with all the ingredients you can\u2019t even pronounce. I have had an ice cream maker for 30 plus years and just stopped using it for some reason. After reading ice cream labels decided it was time to dig it out again and I am so happy I did. After reading reviews I played with the recipe. I used 2 1\/2 cups each of whipping cream and 1\/2 & 1\/2. Then took 1 cup milk and heated it to dissolve the sugar better, then chilled it before mixing everything together. It turned out wonderful and I am looking forward to making this again in a larger batch because my husband eats a small bowl of ice cream every night :) he is definitely a happy camper.",

I follow a ketogenic diet, and have found ways to modify most things so that I can eat them. I used the basic recipe. Substituted allulose (a natural sweetener) for the sugar, and full fat coconut milk for the half and half. Its WONDERFUL!!! Make this your own. add in chocolate chips. berries. some caramel ice cream topping (or make your own) use flavorings. etc. You wont be sorry!!! Everyone in my house is happy.

I'll  be hesitant to try any other recipes since this one was such a winner.  I can't wait to try the fruit versions suggested here, and I think I'll try switching up the extract to coconut and adding some toasted coconut as well to make a coconut ice cream.",
